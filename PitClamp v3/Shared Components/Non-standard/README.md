These are non-standard parts that may be better for certain setups  
  

## Official non-standard parts:  
  
### /Handles/Handle_Forward
Remix author: armpit  
Default handle with an 80 degree bend to allow for PitClamp v3 use in setups where the handle cannot extend down past the PitClamp Base  

### /Motor Ring Tighter/PitClamp_v3_Motor_Ring_Half_Tighter_Tolerances
Remix author: armpit  
From discord feedback, this ring version reduces horizonal ring slop from about 1mm down to 0.2mm total. This should allow for proper alignment in non-standard OSSM Head setups

## 3rd party non-standard parts:  

### /20-4040/PitClamp_v3_Ring_Base_M5
Remix author: Macarize  
Default PitClamp v3 Base - 4040, but for 20-4040 extrusion and M5 holes  
  
### /dbiesn Head/PitClamp_v3_Motor_Ring_Half_EXTRAGRIP_dbiesn_head
Remix author: Jack   
Default Motor Ring Half EXTRAGRIP version for use with the dbiesn head  
  
### /Shortened Dogbones/
Remix author: Jack  
Default Dogbones shortened as much as possible for setups where tighter clamping grip is desired
